# Connect-Four
First project in JavaScript, followed a tutorial and customized some functionality to my liking

## Getting Started

To enjoy a game of Connect Four, simply open index.hmtl in your prefered browser.

### About the project

I wanted to start somewhere with JS and decided that a simple game of Connect Four would be as good a place as any to start.

I wrote the following a tutorial by Justin Kim: 
( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi5hEH1KNEc&feature=youtu.be ),
and applied some of my changes.

Since I wanted the player to be able to see exactly where their next marker would be placed I implemented some other functionality than provided by the tutorial.

The tutorial shows the player which column the marker will be dropped into, I changed this to show the player exactly where the marker will be placed instead.
